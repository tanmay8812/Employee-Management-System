# Employee-Management-System

The task is to create a Database-driven Employee Management System in Python that will store the information in the MySQL Database. The script will contain the following operations :

Add Employee
Remove Employee
Promote Employee
Display Employees
The idea is that we perform different changes in our Employee Record by using different functions for example the Add_Employee will insert a new row in our Employee, also, we will create a Remove Employee Function which will delete the record of any particular existing employee in our Employee table. This System works on the concepts of taking the information from the database making required changes in the fetched data and applying the changes in the record which we will see in our Promote Employee System. We can also have information about all the existing employees by using the Display Employee function. The main advantage of connecting our program to the database is that the information becomes lossless even after closing our program a number of times.
